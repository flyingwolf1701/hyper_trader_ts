Implement PostgreSQL database schema and migrations
Create basic trading plan data models and API endpoints
Establish HyperLiquid WebSocket connection for market data

Phase 2: Fibonacci Calculation Engine

Build real-time price monitoring and retracement detection
Create automated hedge trigger system (23% pullback)
Develop dynamic stop loss management

Phase 3: Trading Execution

Integrate CCXT for HyperLiquid order execution
Implement automated hedge execution (sell 50% + short 50%)
Build position scaling logic for 38% and 50% retracements
Add manual override and emergency stop functionality

Phase 4: Portfolio Management

Create multi-position portfolio allocation system
Implement cash reserve management with configurable targets
Build spot savings feature for long-term accumulation
Add portfolio rebalancing and position exit capabilities

Phase 5: Frontend Interface

Design and build trading plan creation interface

Phase 6: Advanced Features

Add trend analysis and fractal reset logic
Implement advanced risk management controls
Create performance analytics and strategy optimization
Build mobile-responsive interface for monitoring

Phase 7: Production Readiness

Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery
Add extensive logging and monitoring capabilities
Create backup and disaster recovery procedures
Optimize performance for high-frequency market data

Strategy Implementation Notes
Position-Relative Fibonacci System

All calculations based on position entry price and highest point reached
Retracements measured as percentages of unrealized gains, not absolute price
Dynamic recalculation as new highs are established
Automatic reset when taking profits and re-entering positions

Risk Management Philosophy

Maximum 23% drawdown from any position peak
Capture 77% of upward moves through systematic hedging
Never attempt to time exact peaks or bottoms
Maintain long bias in bull markets with short hedges for protection

Portfolio Allocation Strategy

Support single coin focus or diversified multi-coin approach
Local compounding within individual coin allocations
Graceful exit capability for underperforming positions
Automatic cash and spot savings management

Current State Summary

✅ Project Vision: Clear strategy and technical requirements defined
✅ Architecture: Modern tech stack selected (Python/FastAPI + Nuxt 4)
❌ Implementation: Core trading features need development
❌ Integration: HyperLiquid WebSocket and CCXT integration pending
❌ UI: Trading interface components need creation
❌ Database: Schema design and implementation required

The project is positioned to begin core development of the Fibonacci hedging trading system with a clear roadmap from infrastructure to advanced portfolio management features.
